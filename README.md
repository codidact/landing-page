## Setting up your local development environment

Ensure node and npm are installed locally [(nvm recommended)](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm).  
Run `npm install` to install project dependencies.

### Linting
Whilst CI tools will be used at a later date, before submitting a PR ensure your code is linted
running `npm run lint`. Any submitted PRs wil lbe rejected if linting does not pass.
